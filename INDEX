diffLRpath              To find different enriched pathway between two
                        group cells
dotPlot                 To present a dot plot for specific
                        ligand-receptor pairs in specific clusters
findLRpairs             To find marker ligands and marker receptors
findLRpath              To find those pathways in which the genesets
                        show overlap with the marker ligand and
                        receptor genes in our dataset
findReceptor            To find the downstream identity class of
                        specific ligand released by specific upstream
                        identity class
